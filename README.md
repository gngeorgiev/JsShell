# JShell - WIP

JShell is a JavaScript based unix shell that allows you to execute unix commands and JavaScript code directly in your terminal.
The configs and scripts are also pure JavaScript, bye bye long and ugly `.bashrc`.

# Demo

# Example configuration file

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = function (shell) {
    return {
        prompt: () => {
            const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString().green;
            const cwd = shell.cwd.cyan;
            const sign = '$'.yellow;

            const isGitRepo = fs.existsSync(path.join(shell.absoluteCwd, '.git'));
            let gitBranch = isGitRepo ? shell.exec('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD').trim() : 'not a repo';
            gitBranch = ('{' + gitBranch + '}').red;

            return `${time} ${cwd} ${gitBranch} ${sign} `;
        }
    }
};
```
